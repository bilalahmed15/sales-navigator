Known for starting organizations in technology, education, and psychology industries, Tom Hudock is more than a startup junkie, he is a successful coach and mentor, advocate, and partner. And in a world where business leaders are lauded for being harsh and feared, Tom does it all with compassion for the people, process, and product he aims to elevate. But as with many entrepreneurial stories, his travels have not always been an easy one.

As a young man, Tom dropped out from an Engineering degree to pursue the development of Canada's 2nd Microsoft Windows-based Point-Of-Sale software. Tom seized the moment by connecting the latest technology with the needs of retail business and sold his system between the north west of Canada all the way through to the south east of America. After selling to a plastics and paints retailer, Tom cut his teeth with business consulting for government and big business, while having started another Software as a Service business and a boutique marketing agency.

But with multiple successes, tough lessons often come in the form of humility. In 2015, Tom co-founded his first non-profit, Rethink Thinking Foundation, which ran large weekend events for 250 teenagers to explore their innovative ideas with headliners, such as, Sir Ken Robinson. His vision was refined into starting his second non-profit, Arc Academy of Inquiry, which was a registered middle school with the philosophy of guiding students towards self-direction, resilience, and inquiry-based learning. Unfortunately, Arc Academy of Inquiry was forced to close it's school doors when COVID-19 struck Canada in 2020.

With these failures and significant challenges, also came deep lessons and clarity. He is an advocate for the underdog and finds his strongest inspiration by investing in people with personal drive and forward-thinking ideas.

I’m Michael Betel, President and Founder of the Fatty Liver Alliance, and I’ve dedicated over 30 years to advancing liver health—from leading public education campaigns to shaping global strategies for MASLD and MASH.

Based in Toronto, I lead one of the most visible liver health charities. At FLA, we deliver community screening programs, raise awareness through digital education, and advocate for earlier diagnosis, reduced stigma, and better patient care.

My career spans leadership roles in both commercial and nonprofit sectors—from Business Unit Director in Virology and Oncology at Hoffmann-La Roche, to Director of Donor Relations at Canadian Blood Services, to serving 9 years on the board of a national liver-focused charity. This cross-sector experience fuels my belief that real change happens when patients, clinicians, researchers, and industry work together.

I’ve served on advisory boards for Regeneron, Madrigal, Novo Nordisk, PPD/Evidera, and CASL, and am a member of the Liver Forum for Collaborative Research and Global NASH Council. I’ve spoken at EASL, ISPOR, DDW, AASLD, ECCO, and Obesity Canada, and participated in the SLD Global Think-Tank. I’ve also consulted with Worldwide Clinical Trials, Hoffmann-La Roche, and Boehringer Ingelheim.

I’ve proudly:

* Chaired the Global Liver Institute’s Liver Action Network

* Received GLI’s 2024 Global Excellence in Advocacy Award

* Awarded the Canadian Liver Foundation’s 50th Anniversary Recognition Medal (2019)

* Co-authored the People-First Liver Charter (Nature Medicine, 2025)

* Spearheaded national MASLD/MASH research led by Queen’s University, focused on primary care access

* Contributed to peer-reviewed publications on liver screening, stigma, patient preferences, and global action

* Created the 30-Day Glucose Challenge and Your Liver, Your Health

* Host the Primary Care MASLD/MASH Summit, now in its 4th year

I believe every person deserves to be seen, heard, and supported in their liver health journey.

Areas of Expertise:

Liver Disease Advocacy (MASLD, MASH) | Strategic Health Communication | Nonprofit Leadership | Virology & Oncology | Conference Speaking & Moderation | Community Health Engagement | Stakeholder Collaboration | Health Policy & Nomenclature Consensus | Funded Research Strategy | Peer-reviewed Publication | Digital Patient Empowerment | Public Awareness Campaigns | Thought Leader Liaison | Strategic Planning
