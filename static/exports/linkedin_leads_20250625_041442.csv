Now everyone’s talking about Ai*? Must be the POCUS thing. Not potus or hocus, far from bogus — NorVue helps doctors work WELL. *Ai Phi: Cardiologist, Entrepreneur, Agent of Change","Hi there! My name is Ai Phi.

I'm someone who finds joy and happiness in life's ups and downs. My journey to this point has been a wild rollercoaster - from graduating medical school in 2015 and feeling quite alone and different, to traveling around the world, starting my fellowship in cardiology, entering the business-world, and soon becoming a cardiologist. These experiences have shaped who I am today.

My parents were refugees during the Vietnam War and were incredibly lucky to find a new home in Norway. I was born on December 13th in a small apartment in Oslo, the youngest of three siblings. We didn't have much, but my parents gave me all the love and support in the world. I've always believed in hard work and that nothing comes for free. Growing up in Norway, I had the chance to chase my dreams. I thought I was just an ordinary kid like everyone else.

But life had other plans. I still vividly remember a life-changing day in the intensive care unit. Eight years ago a critically ill patient was admitted, and despite receiving antibiotics, fluids, and other treatments, she kept deteriorating. My colleague asked me to perform an ultrasound of her heart. At the time, I wasn’t very good at using ultrasound. I had tried many times but often failed. However, with the patient’s life at stake, I had to step up.

This was my moment of truth.

I detected my first cardiac tamponade - a massive fluid buildup around her heart causing it to collapse, a life-threatening condition. We managed to insert a drainage tube to remove the fluid, saving her life. When I told my mom about this, she said something that has stayed with me ever since:

""Ai Phi, it’s great that you saved this patient with ultrasound. But everyone should know and understand the use of ultrasound. Help your fellows and share your knowledge so everyone can give and receive the best care.»

Those words make my heart sing.

My parents have been my guiding stars, always there with unwavering support and love. This is for them, so they will always be safe in the hands of a doctor and as patients if they ever need help. That’s why I founded NorVue, to share my knowledge, skills, and experiences in providing better patient care through point-of-care ultrasound. Ultrasound changed my life, and I believe it can change yours too.

If you or anyone you know uses ultrasound, please reach out. I offer workshops, webinars, and help integrate point-of-care ultrasound in various fields.
