Maybe you ask yourself: ""Why Heavy Metal?"" (Feel free to read my short Bio)

Born in 1990 in lower Bavaria, Germany. I grew up in an christian conservative household.

Because I was a trans 🏳️‍⚧️ kid back in 1996 I was bullied by the kids in class & was molested and s*xually abused by a catholic nun which I had as a handycraft teacher from 1996 until 1998.

As an outlet for my pain I started to play the guitar after I discovered Heavy Metal hearing Metallica on the radio in the 2000's.

That's where my journey began.
